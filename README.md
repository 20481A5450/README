# Project Name : Simple ECommerce Page

## Overview

The project is a dynamic e-commerce website developed using React.js. It features a user-friendly interface with a homepage displaying various product categories, each represented by thumbnail images and titles. Users can click on a category to view a dedicated page showcasing all products within that category. Each product is presented with a thumbnail image, title, brief description, and price.

The category page provides filtering options to sort products based on different criteria such as price and popularity, enhancing the user's browsing experience. Pagination is implemented for categories with a large number of products, ensuring a seamless and organized presentation.

Detailed information about a selected product is available on the product details page, including larger images, a comprehensive description, specifications, and related products. Users can interact with the website by adding products to their cart or wishlist.

The project incorporates smooth transitions and animations throughout the application using libraries like Framer Motion, GSAP, or similar. These animations enhance the user interface, providing a visually appealing and engaging experience.

Additional optional features include a responsive design for mobile and tablet devices, user authentication for personalized experiences, and persistent storage of the user's cart and wishlist using local storage or backend services. Advanced animations such as parallax scrolling and interactive elements contribute to a modern and dynamic feel.

The README file includes clear instructions on how to run the project locally and deploy it on the Render platform. Users can follow step-by-step guidance, making it easy to set up and experience the functionalities of the e-commerce website.
